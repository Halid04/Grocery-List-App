# My Journey to Becoming a Web Developer Project 5 -Grocery-List-App
This code is for a Grocery List website. 

The HTML code creates a container that holds a header that says "Grocery List", a section for adding items to the grocery list, and a section for displaying the items. The section for adding items to the list includes an input field and a button labeled "Add". The section for displaying the items is a scrollable list container.

The CSS code defines the layout, color, and font properties for various elements on the web page, such as the container, header, input field, and button. The styles control the width, height, background color, font size, and other attributes of the elements.

The JavaScript code will be used to add functionality to the web page, such as allowing the user to add items to the list, keep track of the date and time, and interact with the elements on the page.
